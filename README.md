# web_prototypes

A collection of applications demonstrating different concepts I come across while learning about web development.

This is a personal collection mainly intendet to be referenced by myself in the future. However, feel free to learn from and use these examples if they 
are useful to you. I do not claim that the solutions in this repo are optimal or correct. After all I'm figuring this out myself as I go. 
If you have better suggestions I'd like to hear from you.

Whenever I use code from other places (e.g. tutorials) I'll try to give due credits.
